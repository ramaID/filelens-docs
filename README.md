## Editing the Documentation

You can edit the documentation by modifying the MDX files in the `/src/app` folder. The site will auto-update as you edit these files. Each page is structured as an MDX file that combines Markdown content with React components.

## Global search

This template includes a global search that's powered by the [FlexSearch](https://github.com/nextapps-de/flexsearch) library. It's available by clicking the search input or by using the `âŒ˜K` shortcut.

This feature requires no configuration, and works out of the box by automatically scanning your documentation pages to build its index. You can adjust the search parameters by editing the `/src/mdx/search.mjs` file.
